		\begin{cvitems}
		\item{Worked with \href{http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~rvenkat/}{Prof. Venkatesh Ramaiyan} to develop half duplex asynchronous short packet communication system on USRP N210 systems from scratch.}
		\item{Designed transmitter with quaternary Barker sequence and RRC pulses to minimize inter-symbol interference.}
		\item{Designed receiver with Harris Rice based timing acquisition, maximum likelihood based CFO estimation, and blockwise correlation for packet start acquisition.}
		\item{Confirmed theoretical results such as exponential dependence of asynchronism threshold on packet length for uniform arrival process.}
