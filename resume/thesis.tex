		\begin{cvitems}
			\item{Worked with Prof. Venkatesh Ramaiyan to develop asynchronous short packet communication system.}
			\item{Implemented half duplex short packet communication system on USRP N210 systems, from scratch, in an extensible manner.}
			\item{Used quaternary Barker sequence, repeated once, and Root Raised Cosine pulses, to minimize inter-symbol interference, in transmitter design.}
			\item{Used Harris Rice synchronization algorithm for optimal timing acquisition, maximum likelihood method for carrier frequency offset estimation, blockwise correlation to find the Barker sequence, in receiver design.}
			\item{Analysed receiver performance against known SNR values, and known levels of asynchronism in packet transmission.}
